# NoD

NoD, short for Network of Devices, is a protocol and technology designed to make data exchange and interaction between devices on a local network intuitive.

2 Parts: client and server.

A network requires a single server and one or multiple clients.

A server can also act as a client

Any device that has hosting capabilities can act as a server

Basic requests:
    * list devices

The base interaction capabilities are packaged as a library, which can
be extended to support additional features and interfaces.
